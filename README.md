# Company Database

## Overview

This project involves designing a database for a company that has employees, departments, divisions, and projects. The database schema is represented by an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and is implemented using SQL and Python.

## Files

1. `the_department_db.sql`: Contains SQL statements to create the database schema.
2. `main.py`: Python script to interact with the database, insert sample data, and perform queries.
3. `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
4. `ERD.png`: Image file providing an overview of the project (Entity-Relationship Diagram).

## Database Schema

The ERD defines the following entities:

- Employee
- Department
- Division
- Project

Tables are created for each entity with appropriate constraints such as primary keys and foreign keys.

## SQL Schema

The `the_department_db.sql` file contains the SQL statements to create the database schema. It includes the necessary tables, columns, and constraints.

## Python Code

The `main.py` script interacts with the database. It includes functions to create tables, insert sample data, and perform queries. The queries retrieve and display information about employees, departments, divisions, and projects.

## Usage

1. Run the `schema.sql` file to create the database schema.
2. Execute the `company.py` script to interact with the database, insert sample data, and retrieve information.
